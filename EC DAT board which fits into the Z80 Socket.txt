How do you feel about a TEC DAT board which fits into the Z80 Socket - With a Z80 socket on the DAT board? This requires the least number of wires run to various points on the board and also allows room for the EPROM emulator board.

I've also omitted the 5 digital inputs.

Thoughts?

Stuart Remphrey Not sure if I'd get this "DAT2" or not; but probably, "just in case it's useful"... ;-)
(edit) WANT: so I could try out JMON!꿙ee More

Stuart Remphrey Hmm, or actually:
Simpler to just socket/replace the cheap latch/buffer chip if(when?!) it blows...

Stuart Remphrey Oh, and Z80-socket-mount is a good idea. Again, simpler.
With that layout, would anything else also fit at the same time? (i.e. expansion socket not blocked?)

Ian McLean Looking good Ben! I never used those 5 digital inputs. To be useful for byte input, it had to be used in "nibble mode", with the 5th bit indicating high or low nibble, which is a bit of a pain because it isn't as simple as masking the input from port 3. I would much prefer an 8 way bidirectional port too.
