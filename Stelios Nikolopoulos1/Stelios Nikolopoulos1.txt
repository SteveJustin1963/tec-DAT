as I said the simplest way you can connect it. 
I've got a 74hc138 decoding the base address and generating 
the ENABLE signal R/W goes to the ground because I'm always 
writing to the display, RS register select goes to A0 
so 20H is command register 
21H is data register 
and the rest is the data bus directly
