SENDING IN PROGRAMS VIA TAPE 

We are looking forward to readers sending programs to us. ... Provide us with a copy of the program. Save it on tape with a crystal speed of half 3.58MHz. ... We also need documentation on the program. Write what it does and where it runs in memory and include any notes you may have generated. The first thing we will do is disassemble it and load it into our IBM clone. Here we can format it for publishing. For the sake of our disassembler, please, if you can, put tables at the end of the program code and write down where the tables are located. This way we can use our HEX dump routine and tack the tables on at the end of the code.
