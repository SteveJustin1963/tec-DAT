## TEC TALK
This page is for TEC owners. Through this, we can conduct a forum on the uses and future of the TEC. As we cannot reply to every letter sent in, we will attempt to answer letters of common interest through this page. When writing in, put your letter on a seperate page if you are ordering kits etc. This helps us file things in some sort of reasonable order. SENDING IN PROGRAMS VIA TAPE We are looking forward to readers sending programs to us. There aren't any in this issue due mainly to the shortage of space. Hopefully, issue 16 will contain several pages or more. A big factor in deciding weather or not we publish a "reader send-in" is the way the program is sent to us. If you do have something to send, here is what we want you to do. Provide us with a copy of the program Save it on tape with a crystal speed of half 3.58MHz. Put your name and address on the tape so we can send it back, if requested. We also need documentation on the program. Write what it does and where it runs in memory and include any notes you may have generated. The first thing we will do is disassemble it and load it into our IBM clone. Here we can format it for publishing. For the sake of our disassembler, please, if you can, put tables at the end of the program code and write down where the tables are located. This way we can use our HEX dump routine and tack the tables on at the end of the code.
